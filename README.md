I'm currently working on my Bachelors in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance at WGU and will be taking Programming and Scripting and Database courses in the upcoming term.

I'm looking for help with anything really, as far as coding goes I've been stuck in tutorial heck for the past few years. Any resources are appreciated!
